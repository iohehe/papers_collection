# Merlin

Merlin is a tool to find specifications(souces, sinks and sanitizers) to enhance the static taint-analysis(information flow analysis).

Before specification inference, Merlin needs to get initial specifications and create the propagation graph, which nodes represent methods and edeges represent flow of data.
