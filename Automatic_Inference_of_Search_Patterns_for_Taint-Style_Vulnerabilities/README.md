## Issue
### Abstract
- **Taint-style vulnerabilities** are a persistent problem in software development.
- while simple instances of taint-style vulnerabilities can be detected automatically, more  subtle defects **involving data flow across several functions or project-specific APIs** are mainly discovered by manual auditing.   
### Introduction
- The discovery and elimination of vulnerabilities in software is a **fundamental problem** of computer security.
- vulnerability discovery becomes an **on-going process**, requiring **experts** with a deep understanding of the software in question and all the technologies its security relies upon.
 
### Conclusion
- The discovery of unknown vulnerabilities in software is **a challengeing problem**, which usually requires a considerable amount of **manual auditing and analysis work**.
